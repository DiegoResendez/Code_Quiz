This project will generate a series of four trivia questions which the user will have 60 seconds to answer.  

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The questions were created from trivia related to the Star Wars universe and the styling was related to the coloring and image of R2D2.  

The questions will change once a button is pushed and the Users selection is stored.  If the User's selection is incorrect, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer.  

Once the User has completed all questions the time remaining on the timer will be the User's score.  

The User will then be given an option to save their name to the leaderboard.
